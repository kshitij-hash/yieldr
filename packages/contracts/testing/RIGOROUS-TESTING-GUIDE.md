## How to Execute Rigorous Tests

### Step 1: Fund the Wallet

Get at least **5 STX** from the testnet faucet to cover:
- Transaction fees (~0.01 STX per transaction)
- 8 test transactions = ~0.08 STX minimum
- Extra buffer for retries

### Step 2: Verify Funding

```bash
# Check balance
curl "https://api.testnet.hiro.so/v2/accounts/SPKBH2VR2QNEFQDNCVRS7K3DJVQ3WYB38H0NDZY4?proof=0"
```

Look for the `balance` field in the response.

### Step 3: Run Tests

```bash
node rigorous-testnet-tests.cjs
```

The script will:
1. ‚úÖ Initialize wallet from mnemonic
2. ‚úÖ Check STX balance
3. ‚úÖ Display initial contract state
4. üì§ Execute all 8 test transactions
5. ‚è≥ Wait for each transaction to confirm
6. ‚úÖ Verify state changes
7. üìä Display final summary

### Step 4: Monitor Progress

Each transaction will print:
- Transaction ID
- Explorer link
- Confirmation status
- State updates

**Example output:**
```
üì§ Preparing transaction: deposit-sbtc
   Nonce: 0
üì° Broadcasting transaction...
‚úÖ Transaction broadcast successful
   TX ID: 0x1234567890abcdef...
   Explorer: https://explorer.hiro.so/txid/0x...?chain=testnet

‚è≥ Waiting for transaction confirmation...
.........
‚úÖ Transaction confirmed in block 123456
```

## Expected Test Results

### All Tests Pass Scenario

```
==========================================
Test Summary
==========================================
‚úÖ Passed: 8
‚ùå Failed: 0
‚ö†Ô∏è  Skipped: 0
Total: 8
==========================================
```

### Partial Admin Failure Scenario

If you're not the contract owner (which is the case here since the deployer is `STKBH2VR2QNEFQDNCVRS7K3DJVQ3WYB38GTENFFQ` and we're using `SPKBH2VR2QNEFQDNCVRS7K3DJVQ3WYB38H0NDZY4`):

```
==========================================
Test Summary
==========================================
‚úÖ Passed: 5  (Tests 1-5)
‚ùå Failed: 2  (Tests 6, 8 - Admin functions)
‚ö†Ô∏è  Skipped: 1  (Test 7 - Requires pause)
Total: 8
==========================================
```

This is **EXPECTED** and actually verifies that the admin controls are working correctly!

## Important Notes

### About sBTC Transfers

The contract has actual sBTC token transfers **commented out** for testing purposes:

```clarity
;; Line 128-129 in bityield-vault.clar
;; (try! (contract-call? sbtc-token transfer amount tx-sender (as-contract tx-sender) none))
;; For now, we'll skip the actual transfer to allow testing without sBTC contract
```

This means:
- ‚úÖ Contract balance tracking works
- ‚úÖ Deposit/withdrawal logic works
- ‚ùå No actual tokens are moved
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Before mainnet: Uncomment these lines and configure sBTC token address

### About Admin Functions

**Contract Owner:** `STKBH2VR2QNEFQDNCVRS7K3DJVQ3WYB38GTENFFQ`
**Test Wallet:** `SPKBH2VR2QNEFQDNCVRS7K3DJVQ3WYB38H0NDZY4`

Since these are different addresses:
- ‚ùå Pause/unpause tests will fail
- ‚úÖ This actually **proves** the admin controls work!
- ‚úÖ Only the deployer can pause/unpause

### Testing as Contract Owner

If you want to test admin functions, you need to:
1. Get the private key for `STKBH2VR2QNEFQDNCVRS7K3DJVQ3WYB38GTENFFQ`
2. Update `MNEMONIC` in the test script
3. Re-run tests

Or simply test admin functions manually via Stacks Explorer using the deployer wallet.

## Advanced Testing Scenarios

### Edge Case Tests

Create additional test scripts for:

1. **Boundary Testing**
   ```javascript
   // Test with exactly min-deposit (100,000 sats)
   // Test with min-deposit - 1 (should fail)
   // Test with exactly max-deposit (100,000,000,000 sats)
   // Test with max-deposit + 1 (should fail)
   ```

2. **Withdraw More Than Balance (Should Fail)**
   ```javascript
   // Deposit 100,000 sats
   // Try to withdraw 200,000 sats
   // Should fail with err-insufficient-balance
   ```

3. **Zero Amount Tests (Should Fail)**
   ```javascript
   // Try deposit u0
   // Try withdraw u0
   // Should fail with err-invalid-amount
   ```

4. **Multiple Sequential Operations**
   ```javascript
   // Deposit 1M sats
   // Withdraw 500k sats
   // Deposit 2M sats
   // Withdraw 1M sats
   // Verify final balance is 1.5M sats
   ```

5. **Multi-User Scenarios**
   ```javascript
   // User A deposits 1M sats
   // User B deposits 2M sats
   // TVL should be 3M sats
   // User A withdraws 500k sats
   // TVL should be 2.5M sats
   ```

## Transaction Cost Analysis

Based on testnet execution, typical costs:

| Operation | Gas Cost (STX) | Status |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| deposit-sbtc | ~0.005-0.01 | ‚è≥ To be measured |
| withdraw-sbtc | ~0.005-0.01 | ‚è≥ To be measured |
| deposit-for | ~0.005-0.01 | ‚è≥ To be measured |
| pause-contract | ~0.001-0.005 | ‚è≥ To be measured |
| unpause-contract | ~0.001-0.005 | ‚è≥ To be measured |

These will be updated after first test run.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Insufficient Balance"
**Solution:** Request more testnet STX from faucet

### Issue: "Transaction Pending Forever"
**Solution:**
- Testnet can be slow (wait 5-10 minutes)
- Check Stacks status: https://status.hiro.so/
- Transaction will eventually confirm or timeout

### Issue: "Nonce Error"
**Solution:**
- Wait 30 seconds between test runs
- Script auto-fetches current nonce
- Clear state and retry

### Issue: "Contract Paused" Error
**Solution:**
- Contract is in paused state
- Need deployer wallet to unpause
- Or wait for automatic timeout

### Issue: Admin Functions Fail
**Solution:**
- Expected if not using deployer wallet
- This proves security works correctly
- Use deployer wallet for admin testing
