## üí∞ Revenue Model

### Phase 1: Free Tier (Beta - Months 0-6)
- Free access to all features
- Focus on user acquisition and feedback
- Build TVL and community
- **Goal:** 1,000+ active users, $5M+ TVL

- Industry-standard fee structure
- Scales with TVL growth

### Phase 3: Premium Tiers (Year 2+)
